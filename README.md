C\'est fran√ßais.

# Translate from English in Spanish
‚ùØ translate eng_Latn spa_Latn "This is Spanish."
Esto es espa√±ol.
```

You can also easily `translate` files from a `--directory` and `--save` to a file.

```zsh
‚ùØ translate --directory . --save en2fr.txt eng_Latn fra_Latn 
```

Using `Translator` with `python`.

```python
from translator import Translator

translator = Translator("eng_Latn", "fra_Latn")

english_sentence = "This is just a simple phrase." or [
    "Those are multiples sentences.",
    "If you have lots of them, load them directly from file",
    "To efficeienty batch translate them."
  ]
french_sentence = translator.translate(english_sentence)

print(f"{english_sentence=}")
print(f"{french_sentence=}")
```

## Languages

Depending on models used, you might get fewer choices but with `NLLB` you get more than 200 most popular ones.

```zsh
# translate -L
‚ùØ translate --language_list
Language list:
    ...
```

From `python`:
```python
import translator
>>> len(translator.LANGS)
202
>>> translator.LANGS
['ace_Arab', '...', 'zul_Latn']
```
