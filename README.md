```zsh
# Translate [FROM] [TO] [SENTENCES]
‚ùØ translate fr "Traduisez quelle que soit la phrase que vous voulez."
Translate whatever sentence you want.
```

Uses Meta's NLLB model [`facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M`](https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M) by default. You can change it by passing a custom flag `--model_id`.


## Installation

Use `pip` to install Translator.

```zsh
‚ùØ pip install interpres

Get Translator version.
```zsh
‚ùØ translate version
```

Translate from English in French.
```
‚ùØ translate eng_Latn fra_Latn "This is French."
C'est fran√ßais.

‚ùØ LANG="fr_CH.UTF-8" translate en "This is also French."
C'est aussi fran√ßais.
```

Translate from English in Spanish.
```zsh
‚ùØ translate eng_Latn spa_Latn "This is Spanish."
Esto es espa√±ol.

‚ùØ translate en es "This is also Spanish."
Esto tambi√©n es espa√±ol.
```

You can also easily `translate` files from a `--directory` and `--save` to a file.

```zsh
‚ùØ translate --directory . --save en2fr.txt eng_Latn fra_Latn -n 24 -e 1000 -b 64
```

Define:
  - `--nepoch (-e)` as small as possible but as big as necessary.
    
    Translator uses this number `e` of epoch to determine 
    the rate of time between updates 
    by the amount of sentences 
    given for translation at once.

    If this number is too small, you will face Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors.
    If it is too big, you will get poor efficency.

    Keep it between 1 and the sum of sentences to translate.

    For maximum efficency keep it as low as you can while beeing able 
    to fit `epoch_split` number of sentences 
    into `device`'s memory.

  - `--batch_size (-b)` as big as possible but as small as necessary.

    Translator uses this value every time it needs to batch sentences to work on them.

    Mostly impacts the amount of sentences to batch togheter from `epoch_split` sentences to translate in one go.

    Keep it as high as possible (<`epoch_split`) but as low as your `device` memory allows to (<=1).

    For GPU using multiples of `2` is best for memory optimization 
    (i.e. `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `128`, `256`, `512`, etc.).

  - `--nproc (-n)` to equal your amount of virtual threads on CPU for maximum performance.

    This value is used by translator everytime multiples sentences need to be processed by the CPU.

    Keeping it at its highest possible value, 
    garanties maximum performances. 

With a good processor and a single fast and large GPU, 
you can translate an average just shy of a 100 sentences per second.

On my Threadripper 2920X's 24 threads, 
using my RTX 3060's 12 Gb of space, 
I can peak at ~97 translations/second averaging a bit lower at 83.

I have not tested yet on my two RTX Titans but if you want to distribute the computation, you'll have to do it manually for now.
It's in my todo list but I won't be offended if you send me a pull request to implement it.

Using `Translator` with `python`.

```python
from translator import Translator

translator = Translator("eng_Latn", "fra_Latn")

english_sentence = "This is just a simple phrase." or [
    "Those are multiples sentences.",
    "If you have lots of them, load them directly from file.",
    "To efficiently batch translate them."
  ]
french_sentence = translator.translate(english_sentence)

print(f"{english_sentence=}")
print(f"{french_sentence=}")
```

## Languages

Depending on models used, you might get fewer choices 
but with `NLLB` you get more than 200 most popular ones.

```zsh
# translate -L
‚ùØ translate --language_list
Language list:
    ...
```

From `python`:
```python
>>> import translator
>>> len(translator.LANGS)
202
>>> translator.LANGS
['ace_Arab', '...', 'zul_Latn']
>>> from translator.language import get_nllb_lang, get_sys_lang_format
>>> nllb_lang = get_nllb_lang("en")
>>> nllb_lang
'eng_Latn'
>>> get_sys_lang_format()
'fra_Latn'
```
