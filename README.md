# Translator
*`Translate`* *`from` one language* *`to` another*, *any `sentence` you would like*.

```zsh

‚ùØ translate fra_Latn eng_Latn "Traduisez quelle que soit la phrase que vous voulez."

```

You can `translate` `from` on language `to` another, any `sentence` you would like.

```zsh
# Translate from English in French
‚ùØ translate eng_Latn fra_Latn "This is French."
C\'est fran√ßais.

# Translate from English in Spanish
‚ùØ translate eng_Latn spa_Latn "This is Spanish."
Esto es espa√±ol.
```

You can also easily `translate` files from a `--directory` and `--save` to a file.

```zsh
# Loading sentences from text files in --directory (-d)
# and --save (-S) the translated sentences in a text file
‚ùØ translate --directory . --save en2fr.txt eng_Latn fra_Latn & bg
# during the translation process
# two buffer files are created
‚ùØ ls ./*.eng_Latn.tmp.txt
‚ùØ ls ./*.fra_Latn.tmp.txt
# This allows for interuptions in the process...
‚ùØ fg
# At the end of the process,
# only when all sentences have been translated, result is saved:
# -   under each respective file
‚ùØ ls ./*.fra_Latn.txt
# -   under --save (-S) if given
‚ùØ cat en2fr.txt | head
# Buffers are also removed
‚ùØ ls *.tmp.txt
```

Using `Translator` with `python`.

```python
from translator import Translator

translator = Translator("eng_Latn", "fra_Latn")

english_sentence = "This is just a simple phrase."
french_sentence = translator.translate(english_sentence)

print(f"{english_sentence=}")
print(f"{french_sentence=}")
```

## Languages

Depending on models used, you might get fewer choices but with `NLLB` you get more than 200 most popular ones.

```zsh
# translate -L
‚ùØ translate --language_list
Language list:
    ...
```

From `python`:
```python
import translator
>>> len(translator.LANGS)
202
>>> translator.LANGS
['ace_Arab', '...', 'zul_Latn']
```
